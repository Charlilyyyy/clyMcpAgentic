"""Short- and long-term memory for the copilot.

* **Short-term memory (STM)** — the running conversation inside a single
  user session. Stored in Redis with a short TTL, keyed on session id.
* **Long-term memory (LTM)** — durable facts about a customer (known
  preferences, past resolutions). Written to the same vector collection
  that the retriever reads from, so the next time this customer opens a
  ticket, semantic_search surfaces it automatically.

The copilot does not need memory to function; the orchestrator works with
no memory at all. But in production, adding STM gives the agents
conversational follow-up ("what about my other order?") and LTM turns the
copilot from reactive to proactive over time.

Redis is imported lazily so the agent layer stays importable in test and
CLI environments that do not have a Redis server configured.
